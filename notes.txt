Planned features (! means priority, * means finished):
!- Can displace friendly creatures
- Creatures can wander across slopes
- Be able to dig holes in ceiling
!!- prevent errors from short distance calculations on different z levels
- bats can fly
- spiders build webs

Okay...so right now we have half build and half dig separately from full build and full dig.
What if the half versions were the standard versions?  Walls would take two steps to build...
...probably okay, since I think walls are a bit of a big deal.  Tunnels would take two steps
to clear, unless we just say that's not how it works.  I think I'm actually okay with that approach.
I'm not saying we should do it, but it doesn't sound horrible.  Yeah okay I'm maybe feelin' it.
