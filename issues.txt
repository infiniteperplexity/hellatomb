Small:
+ don't put graves below water table
+ merge dismantling and harvesting
+ figure out pop-up screen
+ grass grows back?
+ particle system

- particles for spells
- fold Exhume into Dig, make sure their can be non-player masters
- will of wisps
- drain life spell
- zombies attack stuff too
- ghouls attack zombies
- details view
- add lighting

- randomize growing times
- visibility of items and/or creatures under water
- some sort of position tracking (x/y) for survey mode
- stay in survey mode after designating?
- change no hauling to some other name or idea
- add a variety of articles and such to "describe()"
- scroll backwards through message history
- grass dies in shade?
- figure out asynchronous loading of resources
- prerequisite items for tasks
- queueing of zones?
- items have bulk


- something to make it so particle rendering isn't interrupted by normal rendering?
- make it so saving deals with all Types correctly
- consider going over to material/contour system
- clean up the covering up of old symbols
- make months shorter
- create a scheduler for periodic events, so not everything updates on the same turn
