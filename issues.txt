- add a variety of articles and such to "describe()"
- fold Exhume into Dig, make sure their can be non-player masters
- scroll backwards through message history
- details view
- add lighting
- grass dies in shade?
- figure out asynchronous loading of resources
- prerequisite items for tasks
- queueing of zones?
- items have bulk
- particle system
- drain life spell
- zombies attack stuff too
- ghouls attack zombies
- will of wisps
- make it so saving deals with all Types correctly
- consider going over to material/contour system
- clean up the covering up of old symbols
